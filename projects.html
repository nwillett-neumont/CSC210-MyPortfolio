                This is the Projects Page.
                This is where you can find all of the projects I'm proud of.
                I haven't worked on a lot of personal projects, so there's only one basic project so far.

                    <strong>Big Fishing</strong> is a console-based fishing game where the player catches a random selection of fish, gets items to help catch fish, and fights boss fish.
                    This was my final project for our "Object Oriented Programming and Design" class.
                    I spent a lot of time on this, and it also introduced me to Jar format for Java applications.
                    I feel that I learned a lot from this project, and this is one of the things I am most proud of creating since coming to Neumont.
