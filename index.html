                Hello! I'm Nate. I'm a student at Neumont College of Computer Science. 
                I'm currently working to get my bachelor's degree in computer science. 
                So far, I love the school and am eager to learn more about programming.
                More specifically, I find myself interested in low-level programming in languages like C++, but more recently I'm finding myself enjoying application development in C# with .NET, and Web Development.
            </p>
            <p class="main-article">
                I like music, movies, and games. 
                My favorite genre of music is Heavy Metal, my favorite movie is The Thing (1982), and my favorite game is Dark Souls II.
                I also like finding new free and open-source alternatives to proprietary software.
                I am a firm believer in open-source and hope to contribute to my favorite apps someday.
            </p>
