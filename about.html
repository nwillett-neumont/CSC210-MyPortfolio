            <p class="about">
                My name is Nate W. 
                I am an aspiring computer scientist working on attaining my bachelor's degree in computer science at Neumont College of Computer Science.
                My plan is pursue a job in low-level application development, but I am discovering other interests in application development with C# and .NET, and Web Development.
                I'm planning to stay in Salt Lake City once I graduate, and will be looking to stay pretty close to where I am now.
